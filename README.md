## SAFARICOM MPESA STATEMENT EXTRACTOR FOR PERSONAL ACCOUNTING USES
This repository is meant to be used as a simpler way to sort and extract daily transactions done on mpesa for easier accounting into a finance tracker of one's choice.
The idea is to prevent manual reading and recording of mpesa messages from one's phone, which is quite cumbersome and takes up alot of time. 

(Especially if sortingacross several days)

### PREREQUISITES

2. Request and download the MPESA statement document for the duration you want to analyse
3. Check your phone messages for the safaricom Mpesa-statement pdf password (this should be confidential)
